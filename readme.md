#C3.js charts

This is a repository of charts built for The Gazette and KCRG using [C3.js](http://c3js.org/). The CSS, JS and imgs folders are global folder that are used with every project.

Individual projects are housed in projects and have their own CSS, JS, etc. folders. To see examples, go to projects/examples and open the index.html file.

The base folder in the projects folder is meant to be copied and pasted whenever you create a new project. Just rename the folder, place it within the projects folder and hack away.
